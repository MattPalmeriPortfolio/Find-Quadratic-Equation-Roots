	Find-Quadratic-Equation-Roots.cpp (program file containing code)

## Introduction
Book practice project from Problem Solving With C++ Chapter 3. Project 2.
Program finds the roots of a quadratic equation based on user input. Demonstrates ability to prompt user, take input, execute complex math formulas, and output results in c++.

Written using Microsoft Visual Studio. 

## Algorithm

  1. initialize variables a, b, c
2. Do everything within a loop, so user can continue if they wish
3. prompt user for input of a, b, and c
4. do calculations and output
	4a. if complex root, change to positive first and output "i" to denote sqrt of -1
5. prompt user to continue

## Requirements
No requirements or modules needed for running this program.
